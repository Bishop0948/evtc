# Contributing to EVTCAnalytics
This is a documentation for contributing to the EVTCAnalytics library. See the left menu for articles.

> Note that the EVTC Analytics library is currently unstable and
> mainly used by our other projects. The plan is to stabilize the API in a near
> future and provide NuGet packages once it is ready.
