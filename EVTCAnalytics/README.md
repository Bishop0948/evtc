# GW2Scratch.EVTCAnalytics

A .NET library for parsing and analyzing EVTC logs generated by arcdps, an addon for Guild Wars 2.
Built with integration in other projects in mind.

Currently has a somewhat unstable API, changes are to be expected. There is [documentation](https://gw2scratch.github.io/evtc/master/) available.

The library currently targets `netstandard2.1`.

## Features

- Get raw agent, skill and combat item data from logs
- Get agents and processed events with structured data
- Get encounter results

## Usage
Read the [Getting Started](https://gw2scratch.github.io/evtc/master/articles/getting-started.html) guide for an introduction.
You can also look at the [sample project](../EVTCAnalytics.Sample) for an example.

## Contributing

See the [contribution guide](https://gw2scratch.github.io/evtc/master/contributing/contributing.html) for common tasks (such as adding support for new encounters).

If you want to implement something new, it might be a good idea to ask first because some parts
of the codebase are not quite stable yet.
